# JS30Day4_Array_Cardio_Day_1

Today was nothing visually fancy but really important! I'll need to study these and do them over again but I appreciate the things I learned from working with these arrays. Sorting through arrays, and understanding reduce, filter, and map seem like they'll be especially hepful with data algorithm questions during job interviews. I'm starting to get very familiar with the overal syntax of ES6 and getting much more comfortable with arrow functions. 

As usual the deployed project is below, you'll have to open console to view everything!
